# Dataplanets
A mod that uses slightly cursed registry manipulation to add infinite planets to space mods

# The Plan
- :green_circle: Rocky terrestrial planets
- :green_circle: (Rocky) sea planets
- :orange_circle: Stars
- :orange_circle:/:green_circle: Gas Giants
  - Stars and gas giants are currently implemented the exact same way; A bedrock layer, 50 lava, 50 dense gas
  - This is basically finished, I just want to add flares/plumes at some point
- :red_circle: Space Factions
  - Three factions are planned
- :orange_circle: Questing System
  - A simple task-return-reward system has been implemented
- :orange_circle: Radio Integration
  - A way of connecting the cosmos together, like being able to ping weather stations for information
- :orange_circle: Atmospheric and Temperature Effects
  - if it is too hot, too cold, or does not have an atmosphere and oxygen then effects occur
  - (in this commit there is no way to mitigate these effects)
- :red_circle: Creatures
  - :red_circle: Sea Creatures
  - :red_circle: Terrestrial Creatures

# Things this version won't add or are in another mod
- Space Transportation
  - Space Transportation is usually handled externally with something like GCYR or Genesis
- Research System
  - Some mods would require a research system to have tangible progression to reach new systems
  - This is partially implemented for GCYR, but not needed for Genesis
- Space Stations
    - In this version, space stations will likely be supplied external
    - There is a basic implementation of modular space stations in this project
- Radio System
  - Now handled in a separate mod see [This github repo](https://github.com/JSJBDEV/Radios)

This project is made with help and inspiration from team GTIC (more about them to come)
